# LABB 2 APIer

This was the second lab for our Web Application course but first full-stack lab for us.

A simple e-commerce website and purpose of this lab was to practice working both frontend and backend with API calling. At the same time we need to create our own database and design our own page. 

"I didn't realize how important commits were when working on big projects, and as a result, I haven't been committing properly. However, I will change this bad habit in my next project!"
